# RPG

I have created a text RPG game as my semester assignment of BI-PA2 at FIT CTU.

The game allows you to create your hero (on the fly or defined in a text file), move between rooms and also carries out
a very simple turn-based combat (without the player's interference) with the option of giving up a fight if the player has a critical amount of health.

There is also an easter egg, if you type "whoisyourdaddy" as a command (reference to Warcraft 3 series), your hero will gain incredible stats and it will become impossible for them to be bested in combat.

## Looking back years later
This was my first year of programming. This repo features some world class overengineering, if-else branches longer than monitor height and an outrageous amount of code duplication. Do I dare touch it and refactor it? Only time will tell.

But real talk, it's a pretty complex project and I'm super proud of putting all of that together after programming for only 7 months, in C++ of all languages.
