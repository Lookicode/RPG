# RPG

I have created a text RPG game as my semester assignment of BI-PA2 at FIT CTU.

The game allows you to create your hero (on the fly or defined in a text file), move between rooms and also carries out
a very simple turn-based combat (without the player's interference) with the option of giving up a fight if the player has a critical amount of health.

There is also an easter egg, if you type "whoisyourdaddy" as a command (reference to Warcraft 3 series), your hero will gain incredible stats and it will become impossible for him/her to be bested in combat.
